# Simfast21_Galaxies_AGN

This is a modified SimFast21, a code for simulating the 21cm signal during epoch of reionization, which includes recipes to model ionizing photons from galaxies (https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04280) and AGN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05398) source population, see simfast21.ini parameter file for details. The original SimFast21 source code can be found at: https://github.com/mariogrs/Simfast21
